    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA. The top features an introduction and key summary metrics (KPIs) of the total outreach plan. The main body is split into two columns: a left column for interactive charts (channel breakdown, weekly activity volume) and filters (by week, channel, focus area, status, and graphic needed), and a right column displaying a dynamic grid of "content cards." This structure was chosen to transform the dense source table into a highly explorable and digestible format. Users can see the big picture via charts and then use filters to drill down into specific parts of the strategy, with the content cards updating instantly. This is more intuitive for understanding strategic priorities than a static, linear table, and the new status and graphic filters enhance task management. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Table -> Interactive Card Grid -> Interaction: Filters for week, channel, focus area, status, and graphic needed, plus editable links and graphic needed checkbox for each item. Justification: Converts static data into an explorable, user-driven, and trackable experience. Library/Method: Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS.
        - Channel Counts -> Compare Proportions -> Donut Chart -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Provides a quick, visual summary of the communication channel mix. Library/Method: Chart.js.
        - Weekly Activity Volume -> Compare Volume Over Time -> Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Visualizes the cadence and intensity of outreach throughout the quarter. Library/Method: Chart.js.
        - Key Metrics -> Inform -> KPI Cards -> Interaction: N/A. Justification: Offers immediate, high-level summary of the plan's scope. Library/Method: HTML, Tailwind CSS.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
